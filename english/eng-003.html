<div class="stanza-label"><b>1</b></div>
In tenderness He sought me
Weary and sick with sin,
And on His shoulders brought me
Back to His fold again;
While angels in His presence sang
Until the courts of heaven rang.
</div>
<div class="stanza chorus">
<div class="stanza-label"><b>Chorus</b></div>
Oh! the love that sought me, Oh! the blood that bought me
Oh! the grace that brought me to the fold
Wondrous grace that brought me to the fold.
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="stanza-label"><b>2</b></div>
He washed the bleeding sin-wounds
And poured in oil and wine,
He whispered to assure me
"I've found thee, thou art Mine;"
I never heard a sweeter voice
It made my aching heart rejoice.
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="stanza-label"><b>3</b></div>
He pointed to the nail-prints
For me His blood was shed.
A mocking crown so thorny
Was placed upon His head!
I wondered what He saw in me
To suffer such deep agony.
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="stanza-label"><b>4</b></div>
I'm sitting in His presence
The sunshine of His face,
While with adoring wonder
His blessing I retrace;
It seems as if eternal days
Are far too short to sound His praise.
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="stanza-label"><b>5</b></div>
So while the hours are passing
All now is perfect rest,
I'm waiting for the morning
The brightest and the best;
When He will call us to His side
To be with Him, His spotless bride.
