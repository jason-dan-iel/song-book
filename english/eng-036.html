I don't know about tomorrow
I just live from day to day
I don't borrow may turn to grey.
I don't worry what Jesus said
For I know I'll walk beside Him
For He knows what is ahead.
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="stanza-label"><b>2</b></div>
Many things about tomorrow I don't seem to understand,
But I know, who holds tomorrow, and I know, He holds my hand.
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="stanza-label"><b>3</b></div>
I don't know about tomorrow
I may bring me poverty or ease
But the One who stand by me
Is the One that be my portion
And the path that be my portion
May be thru' the flame of flood
But His presence goes before me
And I'm covered with His blood.

<div class="stanza">
<div class="stanza-label"><b>4</b></div>
Every step is getting brighter
As the golden stairs I climb
Every cloud is silver-lined,
Every promise is always shining
There the sun is always shining
There no tear will dim the eye
At the ending of the rainbow
Where the mountains touch the sky.
