Would you be free from your burden of sin?
There is power in the blood, power in the blood,
Would you o'er evil a victory win?
There is wonderful power in the blood.

There is power, power, wonder-working power
In the blood of the Lamb,
There is power, power, wonder-working power
In the precious blood of the Lamb.

Would you be free from your passion and pride?
There is power in the blood, power in the blood,
Come for a cleansing to Calvary's tide
There is wonderful power in the blood.

<div class="stanza-label"><b>3</b></div>
Would you be whiter, much whiter than snow?
There is power in the blood, power in the blood,
Sin-stains are lost in its life-giving flow
There is wonderful power in the blood.

<div class="stanza-label"><b>4</b></div>
Would you do service for Jesus your king?
There is power in the blood, power in the blood,
Would you live daily His praises to sing?
There is wonderful power in the blood
